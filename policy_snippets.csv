Appendix E: Appropriate Experimental Design Methods • Randomized, prospective controlled trials are generally considered the gold standard, however: o In some clinical studies, it may be unnecessary or not feasible to use randomization, double-blind trials, placebos, or crossover. o Non-randomized prospective clinical trials with a significant number of subjects may be a basis for supportive clinical evidence for determining accepted uses of drugs. CLINICAL POLICY Fremanezumab-vfrm Page 5 of 7 • Case reports and chart reviews are generally considered uncontrolled and anecdotal information and do not provide adequate supportive clinical evidence for determining accepted uses of drugs.

Commercial Reimbursement Policy Subject: Modifier Usage – Professional Policy Number: C- Policy Section: Coding Last Approval Date: 06/03/2025 Effective Date: 06/03/2025 Disclaimer These reimbursement policies serve as a guide to assist you in accurate claims submissions and to outline the basis for reimbursement if the service is covered by a member’s benefit plan. The determination that a service, procedure, or item is covered under a member's benefit plan is not a determination that you will be reimbursed. Services must also meet authorization and medical necessity guidelines appropriate to the procedure and diagnosis, as well as to the member’s state of residence. Ensure that you use proper billing and submission guidelines, including industry-standard, compliant codes on all claim submissions. Services should be billed with Current Procedure Terminology (CPT) codes, Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes and/or revenue codes. These codes denote the services and/or procedures performed and when billed, must be fully supported in the medical record and/or office notes. Unless otherwise noted within the policy, our reimbursement policies apply to both participating and non- participating professional providers and facilities. If appropriate coding/billing guidelines or current reimbursement policies are not followed, we may: • Reject or deny the claim. • Recover and/or recoup claim payment. These reimbursement policies may be superseded by mandates in provider, state, federal, or Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) contracts and/or requirements. We strive to minimize delays in policy implementation. If there is a delay, we reserve the right to recoup and/or recover claims payment to the effective date, in accordance with the policy. We reserve the right to review and revise these policies when necessary. When there is an update, we will publish the most current policy to the website.

Anthem is a registered trademark of Anthem Insurance Companies, Inc. Policy The health plan allows reimbursement for covered services provided to eligible members when billed with appropriate procedure codes and appropriate modifiers when applicable unless provider, state, or federal contracts and/or requirements indicate otherwise. Reimbursement is based on the code-set combinations submitted with the correct modifiers. The use of certain modifiers requires the provider to submit supporting documentation along with the claim. Refer to the specific modifier policies for guidance on documentation submission. We reserve the right to review adherence to correct coding for high-volume modifiers. Applicable electronic or paper claims billed without the correct modifier in the correct format may be rejected or denied. The modifier must be in capital letters, if alpha or alphanumeric. Rejected or denied claims must be resubmitted with the correct modifier in conjunction with the code-set to be considered for reimbursement. Corrected and resubmitted claims are subject to timely filing guidelines. The use of correct modifiers does not guarantee reimbursement. Reimbursement Modifiers Reimbursement modifiers affect payment and denote circumstances when an increase or reduction is appropriate for the service provided. The modifiers must be billed in the primary or first modifier field locator. Informational Modifiers Impacting Reimbursement Informational modifiers determine if the service provided will be reimbursed or denied. Modifiers that impact reimbursement should be billed in modifier locator fields after reimbursement modifiers, if any. Informational Modifiers Not Impacting Reimbursement Informational modifiers are used for documentation purposes. Modifiers that do not impact reimbursement should be billed in the subsequent modifier field locators. We reserve the right to reorder modifiers to reimburse correctly for services provided.
